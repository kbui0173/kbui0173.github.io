Hello, my name is **Khanh N. Bui** and I'm also known as **Alex**.

(*Fun fact*: I named my self after the Lion from Madagascars!).

I’m a Data Science major at The University of Sydney, currently in my third year and considering pursuing Honours in Data Science.

## Academic Interests

My academic interest lies at the intersection of Time Series Analysis and Financial Econometrics, specifically where we can leverage Bayesian Approximations to handle uncertainty. My goal is to pursue a PhD and advance these fields.

At my core, I am a Bayesian apologist. It's not just about the computational utility; it's the philosophy of updating beliefs that resonates with me. I often find myself teasing my colleagues: "Do frequentists really think they're going to live long enough to verify those long-run results?" Give me a posterior distribution over a p-value any day.

I have done some projects regarding these topics. [You can check them out here!](../projects/index.qmd)

## Beyond Academia

### *My dream was to become a Professional Golfer!*

Outside of the academic world, my heart belongs to the golf course. I've been playing since I was 10 years old, and for a long time, the goal wasn't just to play, but to go pro. I took my training seriously, competing at a high level and even cracking the top 10 in a junior tournament in Orlando, Florida. Today, I play for the love of the game, but the mental toughness required to compete is a skill I carry into everything I do.

### *My camera is technically my best friend*

When I'm not on the golf course, you'll usually find me with a camera in hand. This passion was born from a quiet realization one New Year's Eve: I scrolled through my camera roll looking for memories to hold onto, only to find it nearly empty. It felt like a whole year of beautiful, small moments had simply slipped through my fingers.

That night became a turning point. I promised myself I would never let life pass by unrecorded again. Lately, I've fallen in love with seeing the world through my Fujifilm X-S20; its film simulations give every shot a sense of timelessness and warmth. Below are some of the fleeting moments I've been lucky enough to keep.
